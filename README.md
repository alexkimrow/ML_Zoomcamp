## Taking the Course
### 2024 Cohort
We start the course again in September 2024.

- **16 September, 17:00 Berlin time**
- [Sign up here](https://datatalks.club)
- Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel.
- Join the [Course Telegram Channel](https://t.me/mlzoomcamp).
- Subscribe to the [public Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com) (subscribing works from desktop only).
- Tweet about it.
- If you have questions, check the FAQ.
- All the materials specific to the 2024 cohort will be in the 2024 cohort folder.

### Self-paced Mode
You can take the course at your own pace. All the materials are freely available, and you can start learning at any time.

To take the best out of this course, we recommend this:
- Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://datatalks.club) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel.
- For each module, watch the videos and work through the code.
- If you have any questions, ask them in the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel in Slack.
- Do homework. There are solutions, but we advise to first attempt the homework yourself, and after that check the solutions.
- Do at least one project. Two is better. Only this way you can make sure you're really learning. If you need feedback, use the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel.
- Of course, you can take each module independently.

## Prerequisites
- Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year).
- Being comfortable with the command line.
- No prior exposure to machine learning is required.

### Nice to Have but Not Mandatory
- Python (but you can learn it during the course).
- Prior exposure to linear algebra will be helpful (e.g., you studied it in college but forgot).

## Asking Questions
The best way to get support is to use DataTalks.Club's Slack. Join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel.

To make discussions in Slack more organized:
- Follow these recommendations when asking for help.
- Read the DataTalks.Club community guidelines.
- We encourage Learning in Public.
